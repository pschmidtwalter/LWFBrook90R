Description: Provides a flexible and easy-to use interface for the soil vegetation 
    atmosphere transport (SVAT) model LWF-BROOK90, written in Fortran.
    The model simulates daily transpiration, interception, soil and snow evaporation, 
    streamflow and soil water fluxes through a soil profile covered with vegetation, 
    as described in Hammel & Kennel (2001, ISBN:978-3-933506-16-0) and Federer et al. (2003) 
    <doi:10.1175/1525-7541(2003)004%3C1276:SOAETS%3E2.0.CO;2>. A set of high-level functions
    for model set up, execution and parallelization provides easy access to plot-level SVAT 
    simulations, as well as multi-run and large-scale applications.
