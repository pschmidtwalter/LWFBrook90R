LWFBrook90R v0.4.0 (Release date: )
==============

Changes:
* result datasets are now returned directly by the Fortran model code, without the detour of writing
  .ASC output text files and reading them back into workspace. This speeds up the simulations.
* runLWFB90(): providing output = -1 instead of an output selection matrix returns two tables with
  simulation results: general daily outputs and layer outputs.
* all column names of the .ASC output objects are now in lower case.
* msiterunLWFB90(): It is now possible to provide individual param.b90 input parameter objects for
  individual climate/soil combinations (i.e. individual locations). The option to provide a list of
  options.b90 input objects was disabled.
* added proper desciptions of model output variables in the help pages of runLWFB90().

Bug fixes:
* zero division error causing infinite relawat-values in the output.

LWFBrook90R v0.3.0 (Release date: 2020-04-21)
==============

Changes
* new function msiterunLWFB90()
* runLWFB90(): model input (param.b90, option.b90, standprop_daily) is appended
	to the return value BEFORE evaluating the output_fun-argument. In this way,
	on-the-fly post-processing of model results including model-input is possible now.
* minor bugs fixed


LWFBrook90R v0.2.0 (Release date: 2019-06-18)
==============

Changes:
* minor bugs fixed
* 'output_fun' argument replaces 'gof_fun'-argument in runLWFB90() for more flexible output.


LWFBrook90R v0.1.0 (Release date: 2019-05-13)
==============
 first beta release: most functionality was taken from brook90r. However, functions
 and arguments were renamed, and a lot of functionality was added.
