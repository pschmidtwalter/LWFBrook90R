LWFBrook90R v0.3.0 (Release date: )
==============

Changes
* new function msiterunLWFB90()
* runLWFB90(): model input (param.b90, option.b90, standprop_daily) is appended 
	to the return value BEFORE evaluating the output_fun-argument. In this way, 
	on-the-fly post-processing of model results including model-input is possible now. 


LWFBrook90R v0.2.0 (Release date: 2019-06-18)
==============

Changes:
* minor bugs fixed
* 'output_fun' argument replaces 'gof_fun'-argument in runLWFB90() for more flexible output.


LWFBrook90R v0.1.0 (Release date: 2019-05-13)

 and arguments were renamed, and a lot of functionality was added.
