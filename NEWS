LWFBrook90R v0.4.0 (Release date: )
==============

Changes:
* result datasets are now returned directly, without the need to write .ASC text files.
* runLWFB90() by default now returns two tables with simulation results: general daily outputs and layer outputs.
 However, for convenience it is still possible to provide an output selection matrix, to return different output datasets at different timescales.

Bug fixes:
* zero division error causing infinite relawat values in the output.

LWFBrook90R v0.3.0 (Release date: 2020-04-21)
==============

Changes
* new function msiterunLWFB90()
* runLWFB90(): model input (param.b90, option.b90, standprop_daily) is appended
	to the return value BEFORE evaluating the output_fun-argument. In this way,
	on-the-fly post-processing of model results including model-input is possible now.
* minor bugs fixed


LWFBrook90R v0.2.0 (Release date: 2019-06-18)
==============

Changes:
* minor bugs fixed
* 'output_fun' argument replaces 'gof_fun'-argument in runLWFB90() for more flexible output.


LWFBrook90R v0.1.0 (Release date: 2019-05-13)
==============
 first beta release: most functionnality was taken from brook90r. However, functions
 and arguments were renamed, and a lot of functionality was added.
