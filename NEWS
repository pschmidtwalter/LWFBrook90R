LWFBrook90R v0.4.0 (Release date: )
==============

Changes:
* result datasets are now returned directly, without the need to write .ASC text files.
* runLWFB90(): providing output = -1 instead of an output selection matrix returns two tables with
  simulation results: general daily outputs and layer outputs.
* all column names of the .ASC output objects are now in lower case.
* added proper desciptions of model output variable in the help pages of runLWFB90().

Bug fixes:
* zero division error causing infinite relawat values in the output.

LWFBrook90R v0.3.0 (Release date: 2020-04-21)
==============

Changes
* new function msiterunLWFB90()
* runLWFB90(): model input (param.b90, option.b90, standprop_daily) is appended
	to the return value BEFORE evaluating the output_fun-argument. In this way,
	on-the-fly post-processing of model results including model-input is possible now.
* minor bugs fixed


LWFBrook90R v0.2.0 (Release date: 2019-06-18)
==============

Changes:
* minor bugs fixed
* 'output_fun' argument replaces 'gof_fun'-argument in runLWFB90() for more flexible output.
