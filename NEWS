LWFBrook90R v0.4.0 (Release date: )
==============

Changes:
* result datasets are now returned directly by the Fortran model code, without the detour of writing
  .ASC output text files and reading them back into workspace. This speeds up the simulations and is
  necessary for the planned release on CRAN.
* runLWFB90(): providing output = -1 instead of an output selection matrix returns two tables with
  simulation results: general daily outputs and layer outputs.
* all column names of the .ASC output objects are now in lower case.
* msiterunLWFB90(): It is now possible to provide individual param.b90 input parameter objects for
  individual climate/soil combinations (i.e. individual locations). The option to provide a list of
  options.b90 input objects was disabled.
* renamed some of the pedotransfer-functions and reorganized the documentation for it. See ?ptfs.
* added proper desciptions of model output variables in the help pages of runLWFB90().

LWFBrook90R v0.3.4 (Release date: 2020-08-28)
==============

Changes
* Adjusted 'table'-method in MakeRelRootDens: The root depth distribution provided in a table is now redistributed to the soil nodes under preservation of total root masses.
* Input changed for soilnodes-argument of MakeRelRootDens. See ?MakeRelRootDens.

Bug fixes:
* zero division error causing infinite relawat values in MISCDAY.ASC-output.
* 'betamodel'-method of MakeRelRootDens returned the increment of the cumulative root proportion at the soil nodes, instead of the relative root density, which actually is the former value divided by the layer thickness.


LWFBrook90R v0.3.0 (Release date: 2020-04-21)
==============

Changes
* new function msiterunLWFB90()
* runLWFB90(): model input (param.b90, option.b90, standprop_daily) is appended
	to the return value BEFORE evaluating the output_fun-argument. In this way,
	on-the-fly post-processing of model results including model-input is possible now.
* minor bugs fixed


LWFBrook90R v0.2.0 (Release date: 2019-06-18)
==============

Changes:
* minor bugs fixed
* 'output_fun' argument replaces 'gof_fun'-argument in runLWFB90() for more flexible output.


LWFBrook90R v0.1.0 (Release date: 2019-05-13)
==============
 first beta release: most functionality was taken from brook90r. However, functions
 and arguments were renamed, and a lot of functionality was added.
