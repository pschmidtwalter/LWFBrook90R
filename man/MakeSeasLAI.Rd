\arguments{
\item{method}{Name of method for generating the sequence. Must be one of "b90", "linear", "Coupmodel".}

\item{year}{Vector of years to be returned.}

\item{maxlai}{Maximum leaf are index.}

\item{winlaifrac}{Fraction of \code{maxlai} during winter (ignored when method = 'linear').}

\item{budburst.doy}{Budburst day of year (ignored when method = 'linear').}

\item{leaffall.doy}{Day of year when leaf fall begins (ignored when method = 'linear').}

\item{emerge.dur}{Number of days from budburst until maximum leaf area index is reached.}

\item{leaffall.dur}{Number of days until minimum leaf are index is reached.}

\item{shape.optdoy}{Day of year when optimum value is reached (required when method = "Coupmodel").}

\item{shape.budburst}{Shape parameter for the growth phase (required when method = "Coupmodel").}

\item{shape.leaffall}{Shape parameter growth cessation (required when method = "Coupmodel").}

\item{lai.doy}{Integer vector of days of years.}

\item{lai.frac}{Vector of values of fractional leaf area index corresponding
to lai.doy (required when method = "linear").}
}
\value{
A vector of daily lai values covering the years specified.
}
\description{
A daily sequence of leaf area index is derived from maximum and minimum values,
dates and shape parameters using different methods.
